#Consistent gene expression of Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Glioblastoma and Melanoma.
##I took 7 cell lines which are related to Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Glioblastoma and Melanoma. I am uploading my Master's project here in this repostory.
I have used Rstudio, Linux, Jupiter notebook, Visual studio here with different types of library in this project.
I am uploading my snakemakefile which i used in this project to download my SRA files, the fastqc files to check the quality control of my data, to build genome index using HISAT2, for the aloignment (single and pairwise), for the conversion of my reads into BAM files, feature counts and normalizing the feature counts.
I used Multiple array veiwer to visualize my data with the help of Rank Products. Moreover i have done also done the Functional analyses of my data using Rstudio.
